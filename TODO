Add config to turn temperature data collection off

Add MODBUS serial communication settings to the config

Need to stop using cron for transmit so we can implement TX_INTERVAL

Setup config option to toggle log level permanent vs log overwrite

Finish pulse code to launch configured channels on boot

Consider setting up bi-directional rsync for remote access back door,
and investigate other backdoor options

Add log cycling service to prevent filling the SD card, but still allow
simple logging via DEBUG config - make log retention configurable
Move logs to database and build log request sms that sends compressed database file
create logdel alias - and sms command to do it remotely.

Consider rsync for sending the data and storing all data in a local 
graphite/influxdb instance

Figure out server data delay

Create email notification of data stopping, with another notification of it
restarting, and when restarting send X bytes based on data stopped window

Fix bug in smsParse that throws exception if there is no message to read

Fix bug in simServer that doesn't show last response until next request

Add realtime clock and stop relying so heavily on internet for timestamps

Add sms control for MODBUS config, SQ, and new Pi data

Modularize code to support modularized hardware. E.g. disect RPi
"ports" (e.g. I2C, SPI, UART, Bitbang other GPIO), into groups
and write code, for each hardware module, that lets it use different "ports",
providing the best modularization options we can
