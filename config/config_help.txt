This defines the config variables that are used by the RPi Data Logger

This is /kwh/config/config_help.txt piped into "more" to stop printing once
the screen is full. Press enter to navigate down through the list or "q" to exit

All config variables are used as global environment variables, and should all
use names that are entirely capitalized.

ADx: Where x represents the analog channel number. This controls
whether the analog channel is enabled or not. The only permissible values are
0 and 1, where 0 is disabled and 1 is enabled.

PUx: Where x represents the two digit pulse channel number. This controls
whether the pulse channel is enabled or not. The only permissible values are
0 and 1, where 0 is disabled and 1 is enabled.

DOMAIN: This is the domain of the server that the KWH Data Logger RTU will send
its data to.

PORT: When the RPi sends data to the server domain, it sends it to this port.

SIM_PORT: When the simServer service starts up, it aquires an available port
starting with 9999 and working up until it finds one that is available. Once
an available port is selected, it is logged into this global variable so all
other code knows where to talk to the simServer.

APN: This is the cellular internet provider Access Point Name, and is used
to request internet access via AT commands. If the APN is unknown, try
"internet".

ADMPW: This is the administrator password. When reprogramming the KWH Data
Logger RTU via SMS commands, the command will only be accepted if the correct
password is provided. The password is also provided to the server to 
authenticate to privilege to log data.

INQPW: This is the inquiry password. When querying the RPi Data Logger for
information, responses will only be sent if the correct inquiry password is
provided.

DEBUG: This controls logging in several of the programs. The higher the number
the more verbose. Be careful not to leave this enabled, as log files will 
continuously grow and waste the sd card memory.

STA: This is the Station ID, i.e. the name of the KWH Data Logger RTU as it is
reported to the server. This ID causes the server to create a new folder in
the database for this KWH Data Logger RTU. If you use an STA that is already
in use, your data will collide with theirs and potentially overwrite it.

TX_INTRVL: This is not yet implemented, but is intented to be used for the
transmit time interval, so that users can implement transmit intervals
other than 1 minute, which is currently hardcoded.
